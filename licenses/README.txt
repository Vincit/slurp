This folder contains license files for third party source code, style sheets and fonts that are distributed with this software. If the source code files themselves mention their license and authors, it might be omitted here. In that case see the beginning of the files themselves.

This software also uses Meteor and Meteorite smart packages that are downloaded automatically, but they aren't distributed with this software so they aren't mentioned here. Their source code and license information (if any) are available from the same sources that they are automatically downloaded from.
